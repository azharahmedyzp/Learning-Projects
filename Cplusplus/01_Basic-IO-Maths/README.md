# Basic I/O and Math Programs

This directory contains foundational C++ programs focused on user input/output, basic arithmetic operations, and mathematical calculations. These projects demonstrate core syntax and problem-solving skills.

## Programs

-   **`sphere_volume_calculator.cpp`**: Calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.
-   **`kelvin_to_fahrenheit.cpp`**: Converts a temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit.
-   **`arithmetic_operations.cpp`**: Takes two numbers and performs all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).
-   **`circle_area_circumference.cpp`**: Calculates the area and circumference of a circle using `M_PI` and `pow()` from the `<cmath>` library.
-   **`isosceles_triangle_area.cpp`**: Calculates the area of an isosceles triangle given two equal sides and the base.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Standard Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Basic Data Types (`int`, `float`, `double`)
- Arithmetic Operators
- The `<cmath>` Library
- Type Casting
