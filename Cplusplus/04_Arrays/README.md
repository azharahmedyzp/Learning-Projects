# Arrays Programs

This directory contains programs that demonstrate the declaration, manipulation, and traversal of one-dimensional arrays, which are fundamental data structures for storing collections of data.

## Programs

-   **`array_sum_average.cpp`**: Calculates the sum and average of elements in a one-dimensional array.
-   **`find_smallest_in_array.cpp`**: Finds the smallest element in an array and its position (index).

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Array Declaration and Initialization
- Accessing Array Elements via Index
- Traversing Arrays with `for` Loops
- Basic Array Algorithms (Finding Min/Sum/Average)
