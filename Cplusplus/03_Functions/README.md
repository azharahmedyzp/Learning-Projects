# Functions Programs

This directory contains programs that demonstrate the use of functions for modular programming. Functions help in organizing code, reducing repetition, and making programs easier to debug and maintain.

## Programs

-   **`fahrenheit_to_celsius_func.cpp`**: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius using a dedicated function.
-   **`string_reverser.cpp`**: Reverses a string in-place using a `void` function that modifies a character array passed by reference.
-   **`hms_to_secs_converter.cpp`**: Converts hours, minutes, and seconds into a total number of seconds using a function.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Function Declaration and Definition
- Passing Arguments by Value
- Passing Arrays (by pointer)
- Return Types
- Modular Code Design
