# Control Flow Programs

This directory contains programs that demonstrate control flow structures in C++, including conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`) and loops (`while`). These are essential for creating logic and handling different cases in code.

## Programs

-   **`days_in_month.cpp`**: Takes a month number (1-12) and returns the number of days in that month using a `switch` statement with fall-through.
-   **`vowel_consonant_checker.cpp`**: Checks if an input character is a vowel or consonant using a efficient `switch` statement.
-   **`number_to_words.cpp`**: Converts any number between 1 and 99 into its English word equivalent. Demonstrates complex control flow with nested `switch` statements and a `while` loop for user interaction.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- `if`/`else` Statements
- `switch` Statements
- `while` and Infinite Loops
- Nested Control Flow
- User Input Validation
