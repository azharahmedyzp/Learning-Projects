# Matrix Algorithms Programs

This directory contains programs that work with two-dimensional arrays (matrices). Matrix operations are crucial for many applications in mathematics, graphics, and data science.

## Programs

-   **`matrix_addition.cpp`**: Adds two 3x3 matrices and displays the result. Demonstrates nested loops for 2D array traversal.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- 2D Array Declaration and Initialization
- Nested `for` Loops
- Matrix Operations (Addition)
- Handling Multi-Dimensional Data
